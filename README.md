# basic_password_checker
 v1.0 Basic password checker I made to practice while loops and if/else statements.

 v1.1 Implemented a 10 second wait (using time module) if user enters incorrect password too many times.

 v1.2 Updated the 10 second wait introduced in v1.1 to a live countdown implemented through a function (timeout).
